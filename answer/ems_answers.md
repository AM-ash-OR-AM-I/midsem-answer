### Define ecosystem, write the structure and function of ecosystem

An ecosystem is a region with a specific and recognizable landscape form such as forest, grassland, desert, wetland or coastal area. It is a community of plants and animals that interact with each other and their non-living environment, such as soil, air, and water. Ecosystems are divided into terrestrial or land-based ecosystems, and aquatic ecosystems in water.

The structure of an ecosystem is based on its geographical and climatic features, such as hills, mountains, plains, rivers, lakes, and temperature and rainfall. This creates conditions that support a community of plants and animals that have evolved to live in these specific conditions. The living part of the ecosystem is referred to as its biotic component, while the non-living part is called its abiotic component.

The function of an ecosystem is to sustain life through several biogeochemical cycles and energy transfer mechanisms. These include the water cycle, carbon cycle, oxygen cycle, nitrogen cycle, and energy cycle. Plants, herbivores, and carnivores form food chains, which are all interconnected to form a "web of life" that powers the ecosystem. Ecosystems also provide a variety of products and services, and are essential for the survival and well-being of human civilization. However, human actions such

### What is ecological succession? Discuss primary ecological succession with a suitable example

Ecological succession is a natural process through which an ecosystem undergoes changes over a period of time. It is the process of gradual change in the species composition and structure of an ecosystem. It can be related to seasonal environmental changes or may take much longer periods of time.

Primary ecological succession is the process of development of a new ecosystem in a previously uninhabited and barren area. This occurs in areas where there is no existing soil, such as on a newly formed island or after a volcanic eruption. The process starts with the colonization of pioneer species, which are the first organisms to inhabit the area. These pioneer species, such as mosses and lichens, are able to survive in harsh conditions and gradually prepare the area for other species to come in.

A suitable example of primary ecological succession is the development of a forest on a volcanic island. After a volcanic eruption, the island is left barren with no soil. The first organisms to colonize the area are lichens and mosses, which can grow on bare rocks. These organisms are able to break down the rocks and eventually form a thin layer of soil. As the soil becomes more developed, other plants such as grasses and shrubs begin to grow. Over time, larger trees start to grow and eventually

### Define biodiversity and discuss different values of biodiversity

Biodiversity refers to the variety of life on Earth, including the differences in genes among individuals of the same species, the variety of species in a particular area, and the diversity of ecosystems. It is essential for the functioning of ecosystems and provides various benefits to human society. There are several values associated with biodiversity, including consumptive, productive, social, ethical, aesthetic, and option values.

- Consumptive value: Biodiversity provides various goods and services that can be directly consumed by humans, such as food, medicines, and timber.
- Productive value: Biodiversity is also a source of raw material for various industries, such as pharmaceuticals and agriculture, and plays a crucial role in the economic development of a nation.
- Social value: Traditional societies have preserved biodiversity as a resource for their livelihood and cultural practices. Biodiversity also plays a vital role in maintaining the social and cultural fabric of a community.
- Ethical value: All forms of life have the right to exist on Earth, and it is our duty to protect them. Biodiversity is essential for the well-being of all living beings, and it is our responsibility to preserve it.
- Aesthetic value: Biodiversity is beautiful and fascinating, and its presence enhances the aesthetic appeal

### Define hot spot biodiversity. Discuss two hot spot biodiversity of India.

Hot spot biodiversity refers to a particular ecological region that is home to a large number of rare, unique, and diverse species. These areas are often considered to be the richest and most distinctive natural areas in the world. In India, there are two main hot spots of biodiversity - the Western Ghats and the Northeastern hills.

The Western Ghats is a mountain range that runs parallel to the western coast of India. It is known for its high rainfall and rich vegetation, making it a hotspot for biodiversity. The Western Ghats is home to a large number of endemic plant and animal species, including 1,500 endemic plant species. It is also a habitat for a large number of amphibian and reptile species, especially snakes.

The Northeastern hills, which include the states of Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, and Tripura, are also considered to be a hot spot of biodiversity in India. This region is home to 1,500 endemic plant species and a large number of mammal species, including 63% of the land mammal genera found in India. The Northeastern hills are also a habitat for a large number of amphibian and reptile species.

### Differentiate between endemic and endanger species with suitable examples

Endemic species are those that are found only in a specific region or area and are not found anywhere else in the world. For example, the Indian wild ass, the Nilgiri tahr, and the Himalayan wolf are endemic to specific regions of India and are not found in any other part of the world.

Endangered species, on the other hand, are those that are at risk of becoming extinct due to various factors such as habitat loss, poaching, and human activities. These species are found in various parts of the world and are not restricted to a particular region. For example, the tiger, the elephant, and the rhinoceros are endangered species found in different parts of India as well as other countries.

### Differentiate in-situ and ex-situ biodiversity. Discuss various types of ex-situ biodiversity with example

In-situ biodiversity refers to the preservation of biodiversity in its natural environment or habitat, such as national parks and wildlife sanctuaries. This strategy involves protecting and managing the entire ecosystem, including all the species within it.

Ex-situ biodiversity, on the other hand, involves conservation efforts that take place outside of the species' natural habitat. This strategy involves removing a species from its natural environment and placing it in a controlled environment, such as a botanical garden or zoo.

There are various types of ex-situ conservation, including:

1. Breeding programs - These are designed to multiply endangered species in a controlled environment, such as a botanical garden or zoological park. For example, the Crocodile Breeding and Conservation Program in India has been successful in breeding and restocking thousands of crocodiles in natural water bodies.

2. Gene banks - This involves preserving the germplasm of a species in a gene bank so it can be used for future breeding or research purposes. This is an expensive and risky method of conservation.

3. Captive breeding - This involves breeding and rearing endangered species in captivity, with the aim of eventually reintroducing them into their natural habitat. For example, Project Tiger in India has been successful in increasing the tiger population in the country.

### Write different techniques used for the removal of gaseous pollutants from air

There are several techniques used for the removal of gaseous pollutants from air, including:
1. Dilution: This technique involves dispersing the pollutants in a large volume of air, which dilutes them to acceptable levels.
2. Absorption: This method involves the use of a liquid or solid material to absorb the pollutants. The most commonly used absorbent is activated carbon.
3. Adsorption: Similar to absorption, this technique involves the use of a substance to attract and hold the pollutants. Common adsorbents include zeolites and activated alumina.
4. Condensation: This process involves cooling the polluted air, which causes the pollutants to condense into a liquid form and then be removed.
5. Oxidation: This method uses chemical reactions to convert the pollutants into less harmful substances. Ozone is commonly used for this purpose.
6. Filtration: This technique involves passing the polluted air through a filter, which traps the pollutants and allows clean air to pass through.
7. Catalytic Conversion: This process uses a catalyst to convert the pollutants into less harmful substances. This method is commonly used in catalytic converters in automobiles.
8. Biological Processes: Some pollutants can

### What is eutrophication? Discuss its major causes and  consequences with a suitable diagram

Eutrophication is the process of excessive nutrient enrichment in a body of water, leading to the overgrowth of algae and other aquatic plants. This results in a decrease in oxygen levels, which can lead to the death of fish and other aquatic species.

The major causes of eutrophication include the excessive use of fertilizers and pesticides, which can run off into nearby bodies of water, and the discharge of untreated sewage and animal waste.

One of the consequences of eutrophication is the formation of algal blooms, which can block sunlight and prevent oxygen from reaching other aquatic plants. This can lead to the death of these plants and a decrease in overall biodiversity.

Another consequence is the depletion of oxygen in the water, which can cause fish and other aquatic species to suffocate and die. This can also lead to the growth of anaerobic bacteria, which produce toxic chemicals and foul odors.

The diagram below illustrates the process of eutrophication:
