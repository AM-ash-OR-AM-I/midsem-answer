### What is eutrophication? Discuss its major causes and 2 
consequences with a suitable diagram

Eutrophication is the process of excessive nutrient enrichment in a body of water, leading to the overgrowth of algae and other aquatic plants. This results in a decrease in oxygen levels, which can lead to the death of fish and other aquatic species.

The major causes of eutrophication include the excessive use of fertilizers and pesticides, which can run off into nearby bodies of water, and the discharge of untreated sewage and animal waste.

One of the consequences of eutrophication is the formation of algal blooms, which can block sunlight and prevent oxygen from reaching other aquatic plants. This can lead to the death of these plants and a decrease in overall biodiversity.

Another consequence is the depletion of oxygen in the water, which can cause fish and other aquatic species to suffocate and die. This can also lead to the growth of anaerobic bacteria, which produce toxic chemicals and foul odors.

The diagram below illustrates the process of eutrophication:
