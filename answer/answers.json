    "answer": "\n    Lazy initialization refers to the process of delaying the creation of objects until the point at which they are needed. In Java, this is achieved through the use of the @Lazy annotation. This annotation can be applied to classes, methods, or fields and allows for objects to be initialized only when they are explicitly called upon.\n\nOne example of lazy initialization can be seen in the use of the @Lazy annotation in conjunction with the @Autowired annotation. This allows for beans to be created and initialized only when they are needed, rather than at the startup of the application. For example, a CPU bean can be created and injected into another part of the application only when it is explicitly called for, rather than being created immediately at startup.\n\nSome benefits of lazy initialization include improved performance and reduced resource usage. By delaying the creation of objects until they are needed, the application can run more efficiently and use fewer resources, resulting in a faster and more streamlined experience for the user. Additionally, lazy initialization can also help to prevent potential memory leaks by only creating objects when they are required, rather than having them constantly taking up space in the application.

It is a way to achieve loose coupling between objects, meaning that objects are not tightly dependent on one another. Instead, the dependencies are injected into the objects at runtime, making the code more modular and easier to maintain.\n\nOne example of dependency injection in Spring Boot is the use of the @Autowired annotation. This annotation allows for automatic dependency injection by scanning the classpath for components that are annotated with @Component, @Service, or @Repository annotations. These components are then instantiated and injected into the class where @Autowired is used.\n\nFor example, we can create a UserService class that requires an instance of a UserRepository class to perform database operations. We can annotate the UserRepository class with @Repository and the UserService class with @Service. Then, in the UserService class, we can use the @Autowired annotation to inject an instance of the UserRepository class.\n\n@Service\npublic class UserService {\n\n    @Autowired\n    private UserRepository userRepository;\n\n    // methods that use the userRepository\n}\n\n@Repository\npublic class UserRepository {\n\n    // database operations\n}\n\nThis way, we can access the methods of the UserRepository class without having to instantiate it manually.

Using: The bean is now ready for use and can be called upon whenever needed.\n4. Destruction: When the container is shut down or when the application context is closed, the bean is destroyed. This can also be done manually by calling the destroy() method on the bean.\n5. Instantiation: During the instantiation phase, the container creates an instance of the bean. This can be done using the constructor or using a factory method.\n6. Post-Initialization: Once the bean is instantiated, any post-processing can be done. This includes implementing the BeanPostProcessor interface and overriding the postProcessBeforeInitialization and postProcessAfterInitialization methods.\n7. Destruction: This is the final phase of the bean life cycle. During this phase, the bean is removed from the container and any cleanup operations can be performed.

    "answer": "\nLoose coupling is an architectural design pattern that promotes independence and flexibility between different components of a system. It is an important concept in software development as it allows for easier maintenance and scalability of the system.\n\nOne of the main benefits of loose coupling is that it reduces dependencies between components. This means that if one component needs to be changed or updated, it will not affect the other components of the system. This also makes it easier to replace or remove components without causing disruptions to the entire system.\n\nAnother advantage of loose coupling is that it promotes reusability of code. Components can be designed to be modular and independent, making it easier to reuse them in different parts of the system. This can save time and effort in development, as well as improve the overall quality of the code.\n\nLoose coupling also allows for easier integration of new components into the system. Since each component is independent, it can be integrated without affecting the existing components. This is especially beneficial in large and complex systems where new components are constantly being added.\n\nMoreover, loose coupling promotes better testing and debugging of the system. With components being independent, it is easier to isolate and test them individually, making it easier to identify and fix any issues.\n\nOverall, loose coupling leads to a more flexible and resilient system.",

These individual services communicate with each other through web services or APIs, allowing them to seamlessly share data and functionality.\n\nSome of the advantageous features of using microservices over the monolithic approach include:\n\n1. Scalability: Microservices allow for scaling individual services based on their specific needs, rather than scaling the entire monolithic application. This results in more efficient resource allocation and cost savings.\n\n2. Loose Coupling: Each service in a microservices architecture is independent and can be developed and deployed separately. This allows for faster development and deployment cycles, and reduces the risk of system failures.\n\n3. Flexibility: Since each service is independent, developers can choose the most suitable technology stack for each service. This allows for greater flexibility and the ability to use cutting-edge technologies.\n\n4. Easier Maintenance: With microservices, any changes or updates can be made to a specific service without affecting the entire application. This",

  "26.\u2060 \u2060How does a spring application get started?": {
    "answer": "\n    When a Spring Boot application is created, it automatically configures and starts an embedded server, such as Tomcat or Jetty. This allows the application to be run without any additional setup or configuration. The application can be started by running the main method in the application class, or by using the Spring Boot Maven/Gradle plugin.",

    "answer": "Yes, it is possible to change the port of the embedded Tomcat server in Spring Boot by putting \"server.port=8081\" in application.properties file. This file is used to manage the configuration of the application. Another option is to use application.yml file where the configurations are specified with proper indentation. The preference is given to application.properties if both files are used.",

    "answer": "\n    - @Autowired: This annotation is used to mark a constructor, field, or setter method to be autowired by Spring DI. This enables dependency injection, which removes the dependency of a component from the source code, making it loosely coupled and allowing for easier unit testing.\n    - @ComponentScan: This annotation is used to specify the packages that should be scanned by Spring for components, services, and repositories. It allows for automatic detection of Spring-managed beans within the specified packages.\n    - @Bean: This annotation is used to declare a bean within the BeanFactory. It is usually placed on top of a method and can act as a replacement for the <bean> element in XML configuration. ",

    "answer": "\n    The @RequestMapping annotation is used to map HTTP web requests onto methods in classes that are annotated with @RestController or @Controller. It can be used at both the class and method level and supports all HTTP methods. On the other hand, the @GetMapping annotation is a specialized version of @RequestMapping for HTTP GET requests. It is used only at the method level and is a shortcut for @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET).",

    "answer": "\n    An IOC container, or Inversion of Control container, is a design pattern used in software development to achieve loose coupling between components. It allows for the creation and management of objects and their dependencies, as well as the resolution of these dependencies at runtime. This enables more flexible and maintainable code.",
